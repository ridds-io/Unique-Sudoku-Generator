- You can enter any number from 1-9 in the empty squares.
- Any other key and the number 0 are not recognised as valid inputs.
- Pressing the space bar will Pause the game.
- Pressing the space bar again will Resume the game.

  After pressing the A key however, you cannot go back to your solutions.
  If someone wishes to see the answers, the only way to attempt the same sudoku again is by pressing the 'D' key.

  The timer at the top of the sudoku screen is also restarted.

  or display a Try Again message that closes on its own in 10 seconds.
- Pressing the 'Backspace' or 'Delete' key will allow user to clear currently selected cell,
  (as long as the currently selected cell is NOT a clue cell)
