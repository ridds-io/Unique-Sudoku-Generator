# Personalised Sudoku Generator
A sudoku generator that generates an easier or harder sudoku based on the time you took to solve the previous one


## How it works:

1. Running the code will generate a medium level sudoku
2. It will display expected time taken to solve the sudoku
3. Time for the user to solve the sudoku!
4. If user takes less than the expected time, a harder sudoku will be generated the next time.
5. If user takes more than the expected time, an easier sudoku will be generated the next time.
