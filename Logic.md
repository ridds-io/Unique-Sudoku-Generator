# Logic

The personalised sudoku generator works on four main functions:

1. Setting difficulty of a sudoku
2. Deciding the time required for a particular sudoku to be solved
3. Generating a playable sudoku square of particular complexity
4. Recording time taken by the user to solve

   And then a feedback loop which will change the complexity setter before generation of sudoku
