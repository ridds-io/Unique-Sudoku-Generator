### The personalised sudoku generator works on four main functions:

<br>
1. Generating a playable sudoku square of particular complexity
2. Recording time taken by the user to solve
3. Assume certain time conventions for difficulty:
   for example:

      - easy level sudoku = 5 minutes
      - medium level sudoku = 15 minutes
      - difficult level sudoku = 30 minutes
        
4. Changing the difficulty of a sudoku based on solving time
